# Finite Elements Project
This is a finite element method library that was written in python programing language by James Vance And Elliot Menkah. 

We esentially wrote up a python script to read a mesh file[.msh], that was generated from GMESH, and piped the data-of-interest to the basis functions whiles testing our progress. 

Computationally, the task was divided in three parts:


1. Reading the data file(.msh file) [mesh.py]
2. Evaluating the data with the basis functions (basis_func.py)
3. Putting the written codes together(assembly.py)

A testsuite was also prepared to test the codes as they were being written (testsuite.py).

Please do find detailed documentions in each source code to make understanding of the program easy to comprehend.
