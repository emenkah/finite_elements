# Mini Finite Elements Project
This is a finite element method library that was written by James Vance And Elliot Menkah. 

We esentially wrote up a python script to read a mesh file[.msh], that was generated from GMESH, and piped the data-of-interest to the basis functions. 

Computationally, the task was divided in three parts:
⋅⋅1.Reading the data file[.msh file]
⋅⋅2.Evaluating the data with the basis functions
⋅⋅3.Putting the written codes together.

A testsuite was also prepared to test the codes as they were being written.
